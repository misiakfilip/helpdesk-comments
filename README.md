# helpdesk-comments
This is a simple **Helpdesk Comments** demo application built with Node.js, Express, RethinkDB, and Socket.IO. It allows users to view live updates of comments on tickets and add new comments via a web interface. Comments are stored in a RethinkDB database and delivered in real-time using RethinkDB changefeeds and Socket.IO.
